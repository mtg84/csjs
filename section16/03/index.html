  <h1>JavaScript Is Single Threaded!</h1>
 
  <p>At any given point in time, that single JS thread is running at most one line of JS code.</p>


  <h2>How Asynchronous Callbacks Actually work?</h2>
  <p>THE BROWSER DOES THE WORK</p>
  <p>The browser is separate from JS</p>
  <h3>How?</h3>
  <p>Browsers come with Web APIs that are able to handle certain tasks in the background <br>
    (like making requests or setTimeout)</p>
    
  <p>The JS call stack recognizes these Web API functions and passes them off to the browser to take care of</p>

  <p>Once the browser finishes those tasks, they return and are pushed on to the stack as a callback</p>
